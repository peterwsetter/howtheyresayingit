## How They're Saying It

News outlets are often accused of bias. In most cases, this bias refers to how they frame an issue or even out-right lying. While this bias is important to account for, this project aims to examine the sentiment bias of different news outlets. The analysis will look at sentiment at several levels: headlines, articles, and quotations versus text.
